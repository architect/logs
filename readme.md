[@architect/logs][npm] is a module that retrieves and clears logs associated to
your @architect functions across environments.

## Installation

    npm i @architect/logs
    let logs = require('@architect/logs')

# API

## `logs({pathToCode, verbose, nuke, production}, callback)`

Takes a parameter object as first argument which accepts the following properties:

- `pathToCode`: **required** the local path to architect Function code relative
    to the current working directory, i.e. `src/http/get-index`
- `verbose`: verbose super chatty mode
- `nuke`: if truthy will delete logs via [`logs.nuke`][nuke], otherwise will
    read logs via [`logs.read`][read]
- `production`: if truthy will target your arc project's production environment,
    otherwise will default to staging

By default will [read][read] logs from the staging environment. If the `nuke`
property is truthy, logs instead will be [nuked][nuke].

## `logs.read({name, pathToCode, ts}, callback)`

Will read logs from [`aws.CloudWatchLogs`][cloudwatchlogs], invoking
[`getLogEvents`][getlogevents] for log retrieval.

Takes a parameter object as first argument which accepts the following properties:

- `name`: the CloudFormation `StackName` passed to
    [`listStackResources`][liststack] within which to search Function logs. Note
    that this is inferred from your application name, environment and specific
    function you are querying - tread carefully!
- `pathToCode`: **required** the local path to architect Function code relative
    to the current working directory, i.e. `src/http/get-index`
- `ts`: timestamp to use as a start time for displaying length of time details
    (i.e. `Date.now()`)

`callback` will be invoked with an error if an error arises during execution.
Otherwise, `callback` will be invoked without arguments.

## `logs.nuke({name, pathToCode, ts}, callback)`

Will delete logs from [`aws.CloudWatchLogs`][cloudwatchlogs], invoking
[`deleteLogGroup`][deleteloggroup].

Takes a parameter object as first argument which accepts the following properties:

- `name`: the CloudFormation `StackName` passed to
    [`listStackResources`][liststack] within which to search Function logs. Note
    that this is inferred from your application name, environment and specific
    function you are querying - tread carefully!
- `pathToCode`: **required** the local path to architect Function code relative
    to the current working directory, i.e. `src/http/get-index`
- `ts`: timestamp to use as a start time for displaying length of time details
    (i.e. `Date.now()`)

`callback` will be invoked with an error if an error arises during execution.
Otherwise, `callback` will be invoked without arguments.
